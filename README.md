The Client class contains information about a client (registration date, name, age) and a collection of orders.
The Order class describes an order (price, description).

The program creates multiple clients, adds orders to them, and stores them in a Map collection with the key being the client's passport number.

For each client, multiple orders are created and added to the client's order collection.

After filling in the data, information about the clients is displayed:
- all key-value pairs,
- all keys,
- all values.
